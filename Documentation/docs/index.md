# Welcome to Ubiq


Ubiq is a Unity networking library, for research, teaching and development.

Ubiq is built and maintained by the Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics group at University College London.

Ubiq is 100% free and open source.

## Features

Ubiq's goal is to enable your networked project. It includes message passing, room management, rendezvous and matchmaking, object spawning, shared binary blobs, multiple synchronisation models, lighweight XR interaction examples, customisable avatars and voice chat across Windows, Linux, Android, MacOS, and Javascript running in the browser.
