>The core of the project is the ‘Digital Teaching and Learning Lab’ (DigiTeLL), a virtual communication and collaboration space designed to enable permanent innovation loops. 
In the lab, teachers or student groups will network with each other and with central support structures as part of so-called partnerships in order to implement innovative development projects in courses. 
In particular, the teaching, learning and examination scenarios at Goethe University will be expanded to include digital instruments and innovative learning designs. [Link](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/106206707/Projekt_DigiTeLL)
